# US_Medical_Insurance_Costs

Code Project

This project involves analyzing data from a study of patients, where we have information on age, sex, number of children, region, smoking status, and insurance costs. The goal is to explore the relationships between these variables. To achieve this, we provide graphical representations and a correlation matrix to facilitate the analysis.

Additionally, we include a linear regression model to make predictions about a numerical variable, specifically "insurance cost". By filtering out variables that showed low correlation with the target variable, we refined the model to improve its accuracy.
